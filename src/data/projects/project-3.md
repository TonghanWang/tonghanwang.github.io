        <p>Economics assumes that agents are best responding. When best responses change, utilities may change discontinuously. Therefore, we develop discontinuous networks to deal with these problems.</p>

        <p>For the figure below: (a) The exact surface of the principalâ€™s utility function. (b) A learned ReLU network cannot model the discontinuity of the function
and yields an incorrect contract as shown in (a). (c) A learned DeLU network represents a discontinuous
function and can well-approximate the ground-truth.</p>

        <p>In each column below, we show the ground-truth principal's utility and
the approximation results achieved by our method, ReLU, and piecewise linear discontinuous networks, respectively.</p>
