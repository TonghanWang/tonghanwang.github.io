        <p>We introduce GEneral Menu-based NETwork (GemNet), the first strategy-proof and general auction that supports multiple bidders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We hope GemNet can shed light on theoretical analysis: it shows that multi-bidder auction designs can be similar to analytically optimal designs of their single-bidder counterparts. See figures below.</p>
