        <p>We developed role-based learning, where agents learn their roles to decompose a complex task.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In the figure below, we show changes in roles of different agents in an episode. The role will decide the agent's behavior.</p>

        <p>We studied sparse, concise, but informative communication.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In the following figure, two agents start at a_4 and b_3, respectively, and they want to reach g simultaneously but can only observe its own state. To finish the task, they need to communicate their location to each other.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The second row shows our communication strategy. 0 means no communication. Agents learn to only send a bit when they are one step away from the goal state.</p>

        <p>We find that diversity matters in multi-agent collaboration.</p>

        <p>The following figure shows that our method learns versatile strategies by encouraging diversity in the difficult Google football tasks. </p>

        <p>Coordination graphs: sparse, non-linear, and self-organized.</p>

        <p>The following figure shows how the coordination structure could be adaptive: (a) Self-organized grouping at initialization; (b) Connecting to agent with rich observation for better information sharing; (c) Concentrated collaboration structure around an enclosed adversary. </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>This paper makes
three major novelties. First, to our best knowledge, GA-SPP is the
first gradient-ascent algorithm with a finite learning rate that
provides convergence guarantee in general-sum games. Second, GA-SPP provides convergence guarantee in larger games than existing
gradient-ascent algorithms, which include m × n positive
semi-definite games, a class of 2 × n general-sum games, and 2 × 2
general-sum games. Finally, GA-SPP guarantees to converge to a Nash Equilibrium when converging in any m×n general-sum game.</p>
